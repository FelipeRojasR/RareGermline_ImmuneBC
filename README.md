# RareGermline_ImmuneBC

The association between rare germline variants in (putative) predisposition genes and the composition of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in breast cancer (BC) remains largely unknown. Most BC predisposition genes are involved in DNA damage repair (DDR), and when mutated cause genome instability and thereby adversely affects immunosurveillance. Here we present the scripts used to explore the association of rare, likely-deleterious missense variants (MSVs) and protein truncating variants (PTVs) in 34 (putative) BC predisposition genes, 26 of which are involved in DDR, and the abundance of cytotoxic T-cells, regulatory T-cells (Treg-cells), B-cells and M2 macrophages (M2-TAMs) on 7,969 women of European ancestry.
