# RareGermline_ImmuneBC

Many breast cancer predisposition genes are involved in DNA damage repair, leading to genome instability that can impact immunosurveillance and composition of the tumor immune microenvironment. Here we explored associations between rare germline (likely) deleterious missense variants (MSVs) and protein truncating variants (PTVs) in 34 (putative) breast cancer predisposition genes, of which 26 involved in DNA damage repair, with the abundance of four immunohistochemically assessed immune markers (Cytotoxic T-cells, Treg-cells, B-cells and M2-TAMs) across 7,969 invasive breast tumors of women of European ancestry.
